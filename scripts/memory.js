//when the user clicks on a card for the first time, we'll pick a random colour from this array and assign it to that card

//clickedCards will store the cards the user is currently clicking on, by ID - when two cards are in the array, we'll check if there is a matching ID, and if there is, then there is a match.  However, if the IDs do not match, then we'll flip the two cards back over
let clickedCards = [];

//these two globals are to keep track of the user's progress - one for their score, and one for the number of moves
let score=0, moves=0;
//you can declare multiple variables with one 'let' keyword, by separating them with commas
